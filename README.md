DotVVM: "Javascript" Apps Without Javascript
============================================

DotVVM is an OWIN-based ASP.NET framework that can build line-of-business applications and SPAs without writing tons of Javascript code. You only have to write a viewmodel in C# and a view in HTML and DotVVM will generate the rest for you.

DotVVM is inspired by ASP.NET WebForms, but it is much more modern. It brings full MVVM experience and it uses KnockoutJS on the client side.
